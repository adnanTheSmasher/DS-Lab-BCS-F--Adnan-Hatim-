/*
Task #3:  
Design a program to handle marks of students in different courses using a jagged array (since each student is enrolled in a different number of courses).  
=> Input the number of courses each student takes.  
=> Dynamically allocate memory for each student accordingly.  
=> Calculate and display each studentâ€™s average marks.
